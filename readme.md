I decided to remake a website for a random Toronto business. I picked [Jimmy's Coffee]. I used their:
* background image
* colour palette
* copy
* pictures
* fonts

and remade them all into **[this]**.

I split the CSS files, to make my life easier while playing around with the styles.
* normalize.css - downloaded from [this page]
* clearfix.css - from the notes
* border-box.css - also from the notes
* nav.css - styles the navigation bar at the top of the screen
* center-cropped.css - styles the staff pictures, using [this StackOverflow discussion] as a reference
* social.css - styles the social media icons, using [this tutorial] as a reference
* location.css - styles the location sections
* sidebar.css - styles the sidebar

With the help of blog posts and tutorials, I did a few things that we haven't covered in class yet:
* [nav bars]
* [social media icons]
* [cropping and centering an image]
